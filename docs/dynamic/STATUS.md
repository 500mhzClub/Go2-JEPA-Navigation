# Dynamic environments and continuous commands: status

The place to resume from. Plan: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Branch `feature/dynamic-continuous`.

## P1: locomotion policy on command ranges (23 October)

`outputs/locomotion/continuous_seed11`:
- `go2nav.locomotion.train --config configs/locomotion/continuous_ppo.yaml`, seed 11, 4,096 robots, 1,500 iterations,
  about 22 min on the R9700.
- Commands are drawn from a mixture: 50% uniform over forward -0.25 to 0.45 m/s, lateral ±0.20 m/s and yaw ±0.8
  rad/s; 30% the nine primitives; 20% hold.

Benchmark (`go2nav.locomotion.benchmark`; `outputs/locomotion/benchmark_{original_lattice,continuous_seed11}{,_mu0.3}.json`).
The lattice is 90 commands (6 forward x 3 lateral x 5 yaw), 8 robots each. Errors are RMS in (forward m/s, lateral
m/s, yaw rad/s). The shipped policy is measured on the same grid.

| | Shipped policy | Continuous policy |
|---|---|---|
| Lattice within M1 (0.05 m/s, 0.1 rad/s, no resets), nominal floor | 17/90 | **87/90** |
| Lattice within M1, friction 0.3 | 13/90 | 80/90 |
| Lattice median RMS, nominal | 0.034, 0.188, 0.066 | **0.019, 0.022, 0.027** |
| Lattice worst RMS, nominal | 0.144, 0.288, 0.173 | 0.043, 0.062, 0.074 |
| Continuous switching, settled error, nominal | 0.032, 0.105, 0.045 | 0.016, 0.016, 0.019 |
| Continuous switching resets, friction 0.3 | 15 | 5 |

- **M1 (the range): 87/90.**
  - The three misses are the extreme corners: full reverse, full lateral and yaw 0.4-0.8 rad/s.
  - The worst lateral RMS there is 0.062 against the 0.05 threshold. Noted, not retrained.
  - The shipped policy does not track lateral motion at all.
- **M2 (the nine primitives): pass.** They track as well or better on nominal floor, with two small regressions:
  - hold drifts in yaw (mean -0.008 rad/s against -0.002; RMS 0.017 against 0.003);
  - backward undershoots (-0.175 m/s against -0.189).
- **Friction 0.3: far better.** The shipped policy reaches only 0.166 m/s on the 0.30 m/s command and drifts sideways
  at 0.095 m/s; the new policy reaches 0.322 with no drift. R5 at friction 0.30 may improve for every arm, so the
  static baselines may not be "level" on the new policy. M3 measures this.
- **M3:** C1 on the continuous policy, on the 100 benchmark episodes (`loco_continuous_c1.yaml`, cohorts
  `loco_cont_*_c1`). Paired with C1 on the shipped policy, 72/100. Running.

## P2 spike: kinematic obstacles in Genesis (23 October)

A cylinder (0.35 m across, 0.9 m tall) is added as a fixed entity and moved with `set_pos(..., zero_velocity=True)`
every physics step, on the CPU backend. It walks at 0.3 m/s into a Go2 holding position under the policy.

- **Deterministic:** two runs give the same robot and obstacle trace hash and pixel-identical frames.
- **Contacts:** reported in `robot.get_contacts` as robot link against obstacle link: first contact at 3.29 s, 6.8 N.
  The kinematic body then shoves the robot aside, so the mission's contact stop must fire first.
- **Rendering and depth follow the moved pose:** depth along the centre row tracks the obstacle from 1.0 m down to
  0.24 m.
- A free (non-fixed) body moved the same way also works, but with larger contact forces (47 N). Fixed is the choice.
- **Needed in `sim/scene.py`:** `fix_raster_order` checks that the visible population is exactly floor, walls and
  robot, so it must admit the obstacles. The contact topology must name obstacle links for attribution.

## P2: moving obstacles in missions (23 October)

`go2nav/sim/obstacles.py`:
- **Placement:** seeded by set, maze, episode and count. Each obstacle starts at least three passages from home, never
  in the beacon cell.
- **Walk:** cell centre to cell centre along passages at 0.15-0.35 m/s, with random pauses.
- **Polite:** an obstacle stops while the robot is within 0.8 m ahead of it, and turns back after 3 s blocked.
- **Simulation:**
  - The cylinders are fixed entities, moved before each physics step after settling, and drawn after the walls.
  - Their walk state is part of the C0 oracle's snapshots, so its what-if branches see the true future.
  - Missions and cohorts take `--obstacles N` / `obstacles: N`.
- **Evaluation:** the run's `native/obstacle_trace.npz` gives the closest approach from the base to an obstacle
  surface. Each obstacle contact is attributed to whichever body was closing faster.

Checks:
- **Static scenes are untouched:** C1 on R4 maze 30 rerun with this code matches its `rexit2_ref` record for all
  51,010 physics steps.
- **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/test_obstacles.py`): seeded placement, passage-following walks, yield and turn-back.
- **Smoke mission:** C1 on R4 maze 30 with two obstacles.
  - No contact; the closest approach was 0.47 m.
  - The robot never reached the beacon. 83% of its plans were holds, 988 of them `LATCHED_RECOVERY_TURN_BLOCKED`: a
    latched turn that the clearance check keeps refusing.
  - This fits the predicted ghost-trail failure (the map remembers every cell an obstacle once occupied). R7 measures
    how common it is.

R7 (`configs/experiments/r7_moving_obstacles.yaml`, cohorts `r7_obst{1,2}_{c0,c1,c5,c7}`):
- R4's 20 episodes, run as-is on the shipped policy with the six primitives.
- One and two obstacles; C0 as the forecast-perfect reference; C1, C5 and C7 paired with their R4 records.
- Queued behind M3 (`outputs/dynamic_r7_queue.sh`, log `outputs/dynamic/r7.log`).
- D2 needs rewording. C0 shares the harness, so it measures the harness with perfect forecasts, not whether an
  episode can be solved. Ghost-trail deadlocks will fail C0 too.
